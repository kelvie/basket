Installing BasKet Note Pads
============================

To install BasKet Note Pads, just run the installer executable in a terminal and
follow the on screen instructions.

Dependencies
============

To build BasKet, the following development packages are required:

Qt v4.4
kdelibs v4.1
qimageblitz
kdepimlibs v4.1
GnuPG 1.x (optional)

If you get an error message about FindGPGMe.cmake not found, you are probably
missing kdepimlibs.

I have not tested with KDE libraries versions 4.0.x and below.
